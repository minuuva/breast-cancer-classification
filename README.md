# Breast Cancer Classification
In this project, we aim to predict the presence of malignant or benign breast cancer given information about tumorous cell nuclei characteristics. This is a relevant and important issue because breast cancer accounts for one-fourth of all cancer cases and is the most common cancer among women. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data 

Using this dataset, we randomly split the data into a train(80%)/test(20%) sets. We then applied four different machine learning models - logistic regression, support vector machines, XGBoost, and a neural network - and compared their performance. The best performing model was used to be evaluated on the test set to report final results.
